package dataStructures.queue

// TODO: Queues: Lines are everywhere, whether youâ€™re lining up to buy tickets
//  to your favorite movie or waiting for a printer machine to print out your
//  documents. These real-life scenarios mimic the queue data structure. Queues use
//  first in, first out ordering. In other words, the first element that was enqueued will
//  be the first to get dequeued. Queues are handy when you need to maintain the
//  order of your elements to process later.
