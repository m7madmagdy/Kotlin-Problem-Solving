// TODO: Stack Data Structures: The stack data structure is identical in
//  concept to a physical stack of objects. When you add an item to a stack, you place
//  it on top of the stack. When you remove an item from a stack, you always remove
//  the topmost item. Stacks are useful, and also exceedingly simple. The main goal of
//  building a stack is to enforce how you access your data.
